# CLAUDE.md — Rust Centrifugo client SDK

Status: DRAFT — blocks 0–5 of N. Further blocks to be appended.

Markers used below:
- `VERIFY:` a detail not confirmed from documentation; resolve by reading the cited source before implementing. If the source contradicts the scenario, stop and report — do not silently adapt.
- `@A @B @D @E`: test layer that must implement the scenario (see Block 0).

---

## Block 0 — Scope, references, test layers

**Goal:** fix what is built, against which references, and where each scenario is tested.

**Dependencies:** none.

### Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Build vs reuse existing crates (tokio-centrifuge, centrifuge-client) | Build from scratch | Owner's choice |
| Behavioural oracle | Centrifugo Client SDK spec | All official SDKs follow it |
| Implementation reference | centrifuge-js | Widest feature set |
| Wire contract | `client.proto` of centrifugal/protocol | Source of truth for frames |
| Serialization | JSON and Protobuf | Both supported by centrifuge-js |
| Transports | websocket, http_stream, sse | Fallback in this order |
| `closed` client state | Not implemented | Spec marks it optional |
| Async runtime | Runtime-agnostic core; tokio adapter behind the `tokio` cargo feature (default) | Owner's choice |
| Scenario execution | cucumber-rs; `.feature` files under `tests/features/` are verbatim copies of the Gherkin in this file | Scenario text is the test; drift is checked mechanically |
| Real server for @A/@B | testcontainers-rs, image `centrifugo/centrifugo:v6.10.1` | `cargo test` needs only Docker |
| Protobuf codegen | prost, `client.proto` vendored at a pinned upstream commit, protoc from `protoc-bin-vendored` | No system protoc needed |
| Crate layout | Single crate `ferrifuge`, edition 2024, license 0BSD | Split only when a second crate is justified |
| Core design | Sans-IO: the core is a state machine turning inputs (API calls, frames, transport open/close, timer fired) into actions (open/close transport, send, set timer, emit event); the `tokio` adapter performs the actions | Runtime-agnostic without async traits; @E tests drive the clock directly |
| Events API | `client.events()` returns a `futures::Stream` of a `ClientEvent` enum; `client.state()` returns the current state | Idiomatic async Rust, runtime-neutral |
| Code hygiene | Lint levels in `Cargo.toml` `[lints]`: no `unsafe`, clippy pedantic, every public item documented; CI denies warnings | Quality gates hold from the first line of SDK code |
| Dependency policy | `deny.toml` (cargo-deny): RustSec advisories, permissive licenses only, crates.io only | New dependencies must pass it; an exception needs a reason in `deny.toml` |
| Coverage | cargo-llvm-cov, line floor 70% on the library | Mirrors the owner's JVM projects |

Precedence on conflict: spec > `client.proto` > centrifuge-js behaviour. A centrifuge-js behaviour that contradicts the spec is not ported; report it.

### Out of scope (v1)

- sockjs, webtransport transports
- map subscriptions, shared poll subscriptions (experimental)
- client publish debouncing (Centrifugo PRO)
- browser-only options: online/offline network events, fetch/ReadableStream/EventSource shims
- `closed` state

### Test layers

| Tag | Layer | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| @A | Real Centrifugo server, config variants, server HTTP API driven by the test | Behaviour reproducible with a real server |
| @B | @A plus an HTTP proxy backend owned by the test (connect/subscribe/publish/rpc/refresh/sub_refresh proxy) | Server responses the test must control: custom errors with `temporary` flag, custom disconnects, delayed replies, inspecting connect request fields |
| @D | Scripted fake server speaking the client protocol | Server behaviour Centrifugo cannot be made to produce: unsubscribe push codes, missing pings, malformed/unexpected frames, frame-level assertions |
| @E | Unit tests with a controlled clock, no network | Timing: backoff and jitter bounds, refresh retry delays |

A scenario tagged with several layers must pass in each of them.

**Exceptions introduced:** none.

## Block 1 — Client connection states

**Goal:** client state machine `disconnected → connecting → connected` and its events.

**Dependencies:** Block 0.

**Out of scope:** `closed` state; reconnect timing (Block 2); disconnect code classification (Block 3).

**Owner decision (resolves the out-of-scope note above):** the scenarios below cannot pass without a reconnect delay and without classifying disconnect codes. Block 1 therefore implements the spec's classification rule (Block 3) and the verified backoff formula (Block 2), the latter with unit tests; Blocks 2 and 3 add their scenarios against that code.

**Transport and codec in Block 1:** websocket with the JSON codec. http_stream, sse and Protobuf come in later blocks.

**Sub-increments** (one branch and PR each):

| Id | Value clause | Scenarios |
|---|---|---|
| 1a | As an app developer, I want to connect and disconnect a client and observe its state, so that I can drive and react to the connection lifecycle | New client starts disconnected; Successful connect; Explicit disconnect stops reconnection; Connect after explicit disconnect; Connect failures not reflected in state are reported as errors |
| 1b | As an app developer, I want the client to recover from server-initiated disconnects, so that reconnect advice needs no code of mine | Temporary connection loss then successful reconnect; Connection loss then terminal error on reconnect |
| 1c | As an app developer, I want an expiring connection token refreshed, and the client to stop when my callback denies it, so that revoked users are disconnected | Terminal condition while connected |

```gherkin
Feature: Client connection states

  Scenario: New client starts disconnected
    Given a new client
    Then the client state is "disconnected"

  @A
  Scenario: Successful connect
    Given a new client
    When connect is called
    Then the client emits "connecting"
    And then the client emits "connected"
    And the client state is "connected"

  @A
  Scenario: Temporary connection loss then successful reconnect
    Given a connected client
    When the server disconnects the client with a reconnect-advised code
    Then the client emits "connecting" with that code and reason
    And then the client emits "connected"

  @B
  Scenario: Connection loss then terminal error on reconnect
    Given a connected client
    And the connect proxy will answer the next connect with a terminal disconnect code
    When the server disconnects the client with a reconnect-advised code
    Then the client emits "connecting"
    And then the client emits "disconnected" with the terminal code and reason
    And no further connect attempt is made

  @A
  Scenario: Terminal condition while connected
    Given a connected client using a connection token with expiration
    When the token callback signals "unauthorized" during refresh
    Then the client emits "disconnected"
    And no further connect attempt is made

  @A
  Scenario: Explicit disconnect stops reconnection
    Given a connected client
    When disconnect is called
    Then the client emits "disconnected"
    And no further connect attempt is made

  @A
  Scenario: Connect after explicit disconnect
    Given a client disconnected by an explicit disconnect call
    When connect is called
    Then the client reaches state "connected"

  Scenario: Connect failures not reflected in state are reported as errors
    Given a client configured with an unreachable endpoint
    When connect is called
    Then the client state is "connecting"
    And the client emits an "error" event for each failed transport attempt
```

**Exceptions introduced:** none.

## Block 2 — Reconnect backoff

**Goal:** reconnect delays follow exponential backoff with full jitter, bounded by configurable min and max.

**Dependencies:** Block 1.

**Out of scope:** resubscribe backoff (later block, same rules with its own options).

Defaults (from centrifuge-js README): `minReconnectDelay` 500 ms, `maxReconnectDelay` 20000 ms.

`VERIFY:` exact delay formula, whether the attempt counter resets after a successful connect, and whether the first attempt is immediate. Source: centrifuge-js reconnect/backoff implementation. Encode the verified formula as additional @E scenarios before implementing.

Verified (centrifuge-js `163dcba`, `src/utils.ts` `backoff`, `src/centrifuge.ts` `_getReconnectDelay`, `_startConnecting`, `_connectResponse`):
- delay for attempt `n` (0-based, `n` capped at 31) = `min(max, min + rand(0, min(max, min * 2^n)))`, so a delay is never below `min`;
- the attempt counter increments each time a delay is computed and resets to 0 when a connect reply arrives over websocket;
- the first attempt after `connect()` is immediate; delays apply to reconnects.

```gherkin
Feature: Reconnect backoff

  @E
  Scenario: Delays never exceed the maximum
    Given a client with minReconnectDelay 500 ms and maxReconnectDelay 20000 ms
    When 50 consecutive reconnect attempts fail
    Then every computed delay is at most 20000 ms

  @E
  Scenario: Delay upper bound grows exponentially until capped
    Given a client with minReconnectDelay 500 ms and maxReconnectDelay 20000 ms
    When consecutive reconnect attempts fail
    Then the upper bound of the delay for attempt n+1 is greater than for attempt n
    And the upper bound stops growing once it reaches 20000 ms

  @E
  Scenario Outline: Delay upper bound per attempt
    Given a client with minReconnectDelay 500 ms and maxReconnectDelay 20000 ms
    When the delay for attempt <attempt> is computed 1000 times
    Then every computed delay is at most <bound> ms

    Examples:
      | attempt | bound |
      | 0       | 1000  |
      | 1       | 1500  |
      | 2       | 2500  |
      | 3       | 4500  |
      | 4       | 8500  |
      | 5       | 16500 |
      | 6       | 20000 |

  @E
  Scenario: Delays are jittered
    Given a client with fixed backoff options
    When the delay for the same attempt number is computed 1000 times
    Then the computed delays are not all equal

  @E
  Scenario: Backoff options are configurable
    Given a client with minReconnectDelay 100 ms and maxReconnectDelay 1000 ms
    When 50 consecutive reconnect attempts fail
    Then every computed delay is at most 1000 ms
```

**Exceptions introduced:** none.

## Block 3 — Disconnect codes

**Goal:** classify server disconnect codes into reconnect vs terminal.

**Dependencies:** Blocks 1, 2.

**Out of scope:** client-side disconnect code values (codes < 3000).

Rule (spec): codes 3000–3499 and 4000–4499 → reconnect (`connecting`); every other server code → `disconnected`.

**Owner decision (1b review):** the spec's "other codes" covers custom codes only. Codes ≥ 5000 are reserved by Centrifuge and reconnect, as `client.proto` (`Disconnect`) and centrifuge-js specify. Effective rule: 3500–3999 and 4500–4999 → `disconnected`; every other server code (3000–3499, 4000–4499, ≥ 5000) → reconnect.

`VERIFY:` the server HTTP API `disconnect` method accepts custom `code` and `reason`; whether it accepts codes outside 4000–4999 is not confirmed. Codes 3000–3999 are therefore tested on @D. Client-side code values (< 3000): take from centrifuge-js source.

Verified (Centrifugo v6.10.1, raw websocket client, while implementing 1b):
- the server API `disconnect` accepts a custom code and reason and also works for anonymous connections (`"user": ""`, optionally narrowed by `"client"`);
- over websocket the disconnect arrives as a close frame carrying the code and the reason as plain text (not JSON, not a Disconnect push); observed for 3001, 3999, 4000 and 4999, so the @D-only rationale above no longer holds for codes 3000–3999 (tags left unchanged: owner decision);
- codes 2999 and 5000 are accepted by the API but are not valid websocket close codes: the client library reports `1002 Protocol violation` instead;
- a connect proxy answering `{"disconnect": {"code", "reason"}}` makes the server open the websocket and then close it with that code and reason, before any connect reply.

```gherkin
Feature: Disconnect codes

  @A
  Scenario Outline: Application disconnect codes sent via server API
    Given a connected client
    When the server API disconnects the client with code <code>
    Then the client goes to state "<state>"
    And the event carries code <code> and the reason sent

    Examples:
      | code | state        |
      | 4000 | connecting   |
      | 4499 | connecting   |
      | 4500 | disconnected |
      | 4999 | disconnected |

  @D
  Scenario Outline: Protocol-range disconnect codes
    Given a client connected to the fake server
    When the fake server disconnects the client with code <code>
    Then the client goes to state "<state>"

    Examples:
      | code | state        |
      | 3000 | connecting   |
      | 3499 | connecting   |
      | 3500 | disconnected |
      | 3999 | disconnected |

  @B
  Scenario Outline: Disconnect returned by the connect proxy
    Given the connect proxy answers with disconnect code <code>
    When connect is called
    Then the client goes to state "<state>"

    Examples:
      | code | state        |
      | 4000 | connecting   |
      | 4500 | disconnected |
```

**Exceptions introduced:** none.

## Block 4 — Ping/pong

**Goal:** answer server pings; detect a broken connection when pings stop.

**Dependencies:** Blocks 1, 3.

**Out of scope:** client-initiated pings.

Rule (spec): the client answers server PINGs with PONGs; if no PING arrives within ping interval + `maxServerPingDelay`, the connection is considered broken and re-established. Default `maxServerPingDelay` (centrifuge-js): 10000 ms.

`VERIFY:` where the ping interval and the "pong expected" flag are communicated (connect reply fields in `client.proto`).

Verified (`client.proto` at the pinned commit; centrifuge-js `163dcba` agrees): `ConnectResult.ping` is the interval in seconds (0: no pings) and `ConnectResult.pong` whether the client must answer; a ping is an empty `Reply` (`{}` in JSON) and a pong an empty `Command` (`{}`). centrifuge-js re-arms the no-ping deadline on any data from the server, and `maxServerPingDelay` 0 disables the check. Centrifugo v6.10.1 defaults: ping 25 s, pong expected.

```gherkin
Feature: Ping/pong

  @D
  Scenario: Client answers ping with pong
    Given a client connected to the fake server that announces pong is expected
    When the fake server sends a ping
    Then the client sends a pong

  @D
  Scenario: Client does not answer when pong is not expected
    Given a client connected to the fake server that announces pong is not expected
    When the fake server sends a ping
    Then the client sends no pong

  @D
  Scenario: Missing pings trigger reconnect
    Given a client with maxServerPingDelay 1000 ms
    And connected to the fake server announcing a ping interval of 2 s
    When the fake server stops sending pings
    Then within 3 s plus tolerance the client emits "connecting"
    And the client opens a new connection

  @D
  Scenario: Regular pings keep the connection alive
    Given a client with maxServerPingDelay 1000 ms
    And connected to the fake server pinging every 2 s
    When 10 s elapse
    Then the client stays "connected"
```

**Exceptions introduced:** none.

## Block 5 — SOLID refactorings

**Goal:** apply the findings of the SOLID review of `src/` (solidifier skill, `conservative` rigor) so that later blocks (subscriptions, Protobuf, http_stream/sse, more commands) extend the code instead of editing it. Observable behaviour does not change.

**Dependencies:** Blocks 1–4.

**Out of scope:** the features the seams prepare for (Protobuf encoding, http_stream and sse, subscriptions): later blocks. Review finding #1 (one place per timer kind) is already done (PR #16).

**Rules for every sub-increment:**
- every scenario of Blocks 1–4 keeps passing unchanged;
- no observable behaviour change; public API changes only where the sub-increment says so;
- no abstraction without a second, decided use (a Block 0 decision or a later block); for a closed set, an enum rather than a trait.

**Sub-increments** (one branch and PR each, in this order):

| Id | Value clause | Review finding | Structural acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5a | As a maintainer, I want each JSON command to set only its own request field, so that adding a command touches one place | #5, `json.rs` command encoding | `JsonCommand` derives `Default`; each command sets its id and its own field only; codec unit tests cover every command |
| 5b | As a maintainer, I want connection token handling in its own component, so that subscription tokens can reuse it instead of duplicating it | #2, `machine.rs` token fields and methods | A crate-private token component owns the current and pending token, the token fetch, the refresh command and its timers' decisions; `Machine` delegates to it and keeps no token field of its own; scenario "Token refreshed before expiry keeps the connection" |
| 5c | As a maintainer, I want the codec chosen in one place, so that Protobuf (Block 0 decision) is added as a second variant | #3, direct `json::` calls in `machine.rs` | A crate-private `Codec` enum (only `Json` until the Protobuf block) encodes commands and decodes frames; `machine.rs` calls no codec module directly; scenario "The client speaks JSON by default" |
| 5d | As a maintainer, I want the transport kind to be data, so that http_stream and sse (Block 0 decision) are added as variants | #4, transport name constant in `machine.rs`, `WebSocket` hard-wired in the tokio driver | A `TransportKind` enum (only `WebSocket` until the transports block) names the transport in events and selects the driver's transport; `Action::OpenTransport` carries the kind (public API change); scenario "The connected event names the transport" |

The scenarios below guard behaviour the refactorings move but no earlier scenario pins down. They pass before the refactoring; they must still pass after it.

```gherkin
Feature: SOLID refactorings

  @A
  Scenario: Token refreshed before expiry keeps the connection
    Given a connected client using a connection token with expiration
    When 6 s elapse
    Then the client stays "connected"

  @D
  Scenario: The client speaks JSON by default
    Given a client connected to the fake server
    Then the fake server received the connect command as JSON

  @A
  Scenario: The connected event names the transport
    Given a new client
    When connect is called
    Then the client emits "connecting"
    And then the client emits "connected" over transport "websocket"
```

For "Token refreshed before expiry keeps the connection" the @A server closes expired connections after a short delay, so that a client which failed to refresh would be disconnected within the scenario. `VERIFY:` the Centrifugo v6 option for that delay (`client.expired_close_delay`, default 25 s) and its environment variable.

**Exceptions introduced:** 5a adds no scenario: the JSON codec is crate-private and its command encoding is not observable through the public API beyond what Blocks 1–4 already exercise; codec unit tests cover it.
