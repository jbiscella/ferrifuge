## Overview

ferrifuge connects Rust applications to a Centrifugo server over its client
protocol. It is written from scratch against the
[Client SDK spec](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/transports/client_api), with
[centrifuge-js](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-js) as the
implementation reference.

The core is a sans-IO state machine with no async runtime of its own. The
default `tokio` feature adds a ready-to-use `Client` that runs the machine on
tokio. Any other runtime can drive the core through `ferrifuge::machine`.

## Status

Early development; the API will change. Work is organised in blocks
specified in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

Available now:

- connect and disconnect, with the client state and its events;
- reconnect attempts with exponential backoff and full jitter;
- server disconnects: the client reconnects or stops according to the
  server's disconnect code, as the spec defines;
- connection tokens (JWT), refreshed through a callback before they
  expire;
- server pings: answered with pongs, and a connection whose pings stop is
  re-established;
- an `error` event for every failed connection attempt;
- websocket transport (`ws://` and `wss://`) with the JSON or the
  Protobuf protocol;
- http_stream and sse transports (`http://` and `https://`, JSON), tried
  in order when websocket cannot connect;
- the TLS crypto provider chosen at build time: ring, aws-lc-rs, or
  aws-lc-rs in FIPS mode.

## Usage

ferrifuge is not on crates.io yet. Depend on the repository:

```toml
[dependencies]
ferrifuge = { git = "https://github.com/jbiscella/ferrifuge" }
futures-util = "0.3"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
```

```rust
use ferrifuge::{Client, ClientEvent, Config};
use futures_util::StreamExt;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let client = Client::new("ws://localhost:8000/connection/websocket", Config::default());
    let mut events = client.events();
    client.connect();

    while let Some(event) = events.next().await {
        match event {
            ClientEvent::Connecting { code, reason } => println!("connecting: {code} {reason}"),
            ClientEvent::Connected { client_id, .. } => println!("connected as {client_id}"),
            ClientEvent::Disconnected { code, reason } => {
                println!("disconnected: {code} {reason}");
                break;
            }
            ClientEvent::Error(error) => eprintln!("error: {}", error.message),
        }
    }
}
```

To try it against a local server that accepts connections without a token
(see [Connection tokens](#connection-tokens) otherwise):

```sh
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 \
  -e CENTRIFUGO_CLIENT_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_CONNECT_WITHOUT_TOKEN=true \
  centrifugo/centrifugo:v6.10.1 centrifugo
```

### Client

`Client::new` must be called inside a tokio runtime. `connect()` and
`disconnect()` change the state before they return. `events()` returns a
`Stream` of the events emitted from then on; each call returns an independent
stream. Dropping the client disconnects it.

### Transport fallback

To fall back to http_stream, then sse, where websocket is blocked, give the
endpoints in the order to try them. They are tried on the first connection
only, until one works; reconnects keep that one.

```rust
use ferrifuge::Client;
use ferrifuge::machine::TransportKind;

let client = Client::builder_with_transports([
    (TransportKind::WebSocket, "wss://example.com/connection/websocket".to_owned()),
    (TransportKind::HttpStream, "https://example.com/connection/http_stream".to_owned()),
    (TransportKind::Sse, "https://example.com/connection/sse".to_owned()),
])
.build()?;
```

The server must enable them (`http_stream.enabled` and `sse.enabled` in
Centrifugo). They carry JSON only: building a client with the Protobuf
protocol and one of them fails with a configuration error.

### Connection tokens

Set the initial token in `Config::token`, and give the builder a callback
that returns a new one:

```rust
use ferrifuge::{Client, Config, TokenError};

let client = Client::builder("ws://localhost:8000/connection/websocket")
    .config(Config {
        token: initial_token,
        ..Config::default()
    })
    .get_token(|| async {
        // Ask your backend for a new token.
        fetch_token().await.map_err(|e| TokenError::Failed(e.to_string()))
    })
    .build()?;
```

When the server says the token expires, the client calls the callback before
then and sends the new token. It also calls it to connect when it has no
token, or after the server rejected one as expired. Return
`TokenError::Unauthorized` (or an empty token) to disconnect the client for
good, with code 1. Any other error is reported as an `error` event and
retried.

### States and events

The client is `Disconnected`, `Connecting` or `Connected`. Each change emits
`Connecting`, `Connected` or `Disconnected`. `Connecting` and `Disconnected`
carry a numeric `code` and a `reason`. Client-side codes are in
`ferrifuge::codes`, and their values follow centrifuge-js. `Error` events
report problems that do not change the state, such as a failed attempt
while the client keeps reconnecting.

### Configuration

| `Config` field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `min_reconnect_delay` | 500 ms | Lower bound of the reconnect delay |
| `max_reconnect_delay` | 20 s | Upper bound of the reconnect delay |
| `timeout` | 5 s | Time allowed from opening the transport to the connect reply |
| `name` | `ferrifuge` | Client name reported to the server |
| `version` | crate version | Client version reported to the server |
| `token` | empty | Connection token sent with the first connect |
| `max_server_ping_delay` | 10 s | Wait past the server's ping interval before reconnecting; 0 disables |
| `protocol` | `Protocol::Json` | Encoding of the client protocol: `Json` or `Protobuf` (binary frames, any payload bytes) |

### Cargo features

| Feature | Default | Adds |
|---|---|---|
| `tokio` | yes | `Client`, the websocket, http_stream and sse transports, TLS through rustls with the platform's root certificates |
| `ring` | yes | ring as the TLS crypto provider; builds with a C compiler |
| `aws-lc-rs` | no | aws-lc-rs as the TLS crypto provider; builds with a C compiler |
| `fips` | no | aws-lc-rs in FIPS mode; also needs CMake and Go to build |

`tokio` needs one of the provider features. Cargo features are additive, so
a build without ring turns default features off:

```toml
ferrifuge = { version = "0.1", default-features = false, features = ["tokio", "fips"] }
```

When several providers are enabled, the strongest one is used: `fips`, then
`aws-lc-rs`, then `ring`.

`fips` builds the AWS-LC-FIPS 4.x module. That module has been submitted to
NIST for FIPS 140-3 validation but is not certified yet. The certified 3.x
module needs aws-lc-rs 1.17, which only rustls versions with known
vulnerabilities (RUSTSEC-2026-0285, RUSTSEC-2026-0346) accept. Check the
module's status on the NIST CMVP list before relying on it for compliance.

Without default features, ferrifuge has no runtime or network dependency.
`ferrifuge::machine::Machine` then takes inputs (API calls, transport
activity, timers) and returns the actions to perform.

## Development

You need Rust 1.88 or newer, and Docker for the tests that run a real
Centrifugo.

```sh
git submodule update --init      # Claude Code skills used in this repo
cargo test --all-targets         # unit tests, BDD scenarios, fixture smoke tests
cargo test --test bdd -- --tags @A   # one test layer of the scenarios
cargo deny check                 # advisories, licenses, sources
```

The behaviour is specified as Gherkin scenarios in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
Each file in `tests/features/` is a verbatim copy of one of them, and a test
fails if the two drift apart. `tests/bdd.rs` lists the scenarios that are
implemented so far.

CI runs rustfmt, clippy (pedantic, warnings denied) with and without default
features, rustdoc, the tests with a 70% line-coverage floor, an MSRV build
and cargo-deny. cargo-deny also runs daily.

[0BSD](LICENSE). [`proto/client.proto`](proto/client.proto) is copied from
[centrifugal/protocol](https://github.com/centrifugal/protocol) and keeps its
MIT license ([`proto/LICENSE`](proto/LICENSE)).

Builds with the `aws-lc-rs` or `fips` feature include AWS-LC, which is
partly under the OpenSSL license. That license requires its attribution
notice in advertising and in redistributions of the built binaries.
